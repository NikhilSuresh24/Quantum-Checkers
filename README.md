# Quantum Checkers

This repository models the behavior of two entangled qubits and their movement through space using the solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation to propogate the wave function. More details can be found in `problem_statement.pdf`.

## Usage

To run the simulation:

    $ python3 simulator.py

Which runs the simulation with default configuration and the default game strategy.

Feel free to edit the current configurations at the bottom of the `simulator.py` file to adjust the size of the map, initial state and starting locations, and more!

Additionally, if you want to test your own strategies, make modifications to the `spin_strategy` method in `simulator.py`.

## Other files

### `location_tracker.py`

Deals with the propagation of the wavefunction of the location of the individual qubits (gets the probabilities of moving to certain location). Important methods include `step`, `simulate`, and `get_location` (calling `get_location` twice will get you different locations due to the probabilistic nature of qubit movement). 

### `state_tracker.py`

Stores the entangled state and applies any gates to the state as required.
